# Group Manager

### Version: 0.8.4 (in progress)

### Introduction

Group Manager is a utility that creates layer controls for iClone. When using Group Manager, every object that is created within iClone is placed under a group - usually the World group. Each group has it's own properties - and each object assumes the properties of the group it exists under. Group can operate on its child elements in a single operation such as toggling visibility.
