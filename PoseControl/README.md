# PopcornFX Sequencer Demo

### Version: 1.0.0

### Introduction

Pose Manager can be used to record a characterâ€™s pose for the current frame as snapshots. These pose snapshots can be edited, organized and saved as part of a Pose Library. Pose Manager allows you to load, edit, and overwrite existing Pose Libraries. You can apply these pose snapshots to any other character with compatible rigging. The target character will immediately assume the pose of the snapshot to the best of its abilities.
